{{define "spec_input"}}## User message: athletic profile and recent activities

The first message {{if .}}you receive{{else}}the LLM receives{{end}} will be a JSON object that conforms to the following schema:

- **Profile**: The top-level object, representing a user's athletic profile.
  - `sports`: A JSON map that provides constraints and data related to individual sports.
  - `ftp`: The user's functional threshold power (FTP), expressed as an unsigned integer (in watts).
  - `activities_this_week`: A JSON list containing the user's activities this week (since Monday).
  - `activities_last_week`: A JSON list containing the user's activities last week.
  - `activities_older`: A JSON list containing the user's older activities.

Each key in sports is a string, e.g., "cycling", "runnig".

Each element in `sports` is a **SportConstraints** object with:

- `target_weekly_distance`: Total weekly training distance goal (unsigned integer in meters). Note that a week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
- `target_distance`: Target distance for a single session (unsigned integer in meters).
- `target_distance_date`: Date when the user wants to meet the `target_distance` goal, in ISO 8061 format (without time).
- `allowed_days`: A list of strings representing available training days. Each day is capitalized (e.g., `"Monday"`, `"Tuesday"`).
{{- if .}}
- `trains_indoors`: Boolean indicating if the user trains indoors.
{{end}}

Each element in `activities` is an **Activity** object with:

- `time`: ISO 8601 timestamp of when the activity occurred
- `duration`: Activity duration in seconds (integer)
{{- if .}}
- `duration_total`: Total duration including breaks in seconds (integer, optional)
{{end}}
- `distance`: Distance covered in meters (integer)
- `sport`: Sport type ("running", "cycling", or "swimming")
- `vertical_gain`: Elevation gain in meters (integer)
{{- if .}}
- `notes`: Free-form text notes (string)
- `was_recommended`: Whether this activity was recommended by the system (boolean)
{{end}}

All distances are unsigned integers, and JSON uses camelCase field names.
