{{define "plan_combine"}} I previously asked for separate recommendations for
cycling and running. Now Iâ€™d like a combined workout plan that balances my goals
in both sports.

## 3-Day Combined Plan: Cycling + Running

Recommend one workout per day, prioritizing based on impact and recovery needs.

- Reassign or adjust any pre-scheduled workouts (including distances) to better meet overall goals.
- Aim for a balanced routine across both sports.
- Include a mix of endurance and intensity.
- Evaluate recent activities for overtraining risk.
- Ensure appropriate rest and recovery to prevent injury.{{end}}
