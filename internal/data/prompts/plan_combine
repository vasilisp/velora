{{define "plan_combine"}}I previously asked for separate recommendations for
cycling and running. Now Iâ€™d like a combined workout plan that balances my goals
in both sports.

## 3-Day Combined Plan: Cycling + Running

{{ template "sched_constraints_combine" . }}

- Reassign or adjust any pre-scheduled workouts (including distances) to better meet overall goals.
- Aim for a balanced routine across both sports.
- Include a mix of endurance and intensity.
- Evaluate recent activities for overtraining risk.
- Ensure appropriate rest and recovery to prevent injury.{{end}}

Provide one workout or rest suggestion per day (no multi-sport days). If any
adjustments are made to the cycling-only or running-only plans, explain the
reasons behind those changes.
