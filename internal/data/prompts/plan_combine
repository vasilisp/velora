{{define "plan_combine"}}I previously asked for separate recommendations for
cycling and running. Now Iâ€™d like a combined workout plan that balances my goals
in both sports.

## 3-Day Combined Plan: Cycling + Running

Plan cycling workouts only on: {{range $index, $day := .allowedCycling }}{{- if $index }}, {{end}}{{$day}}{{- end}}.
{{if gt (len .disallowedCycling) 0 }}
Do not plan any cycling workouts on: {{range $index, $day := .disallowedCycling }}{{- if $index }}, {{end}}{{$day}}{{- end}}.
{{end}}
Plan running workouts only on: {{range $index, $day := .allowedRunning }}{{- if $index }}, {{end}}{{$day}}{{- end}}.
{{if gt (len .disallowedRunning) 0 }}
Do not plan any running  workouts on: {{range $index, $day := .disallowedRunning }}{{- if $index }}, {{end}}{{$day}}{{- end}}.
{{end}}
Recommend one workout per day **in total across all sports**, prioritizing based on impact and recovery needs.

- Reassign or adjust any pre-scheduled workouts (including distances) to better meet overall goals.
- Aim for a balanced routine across both sports.
- Include a mix of endurance and intensity.
- Evaluate recent activities for overtraining risk.
- Ensure appropriate rest and recovery to prevent injury.{{end}}
