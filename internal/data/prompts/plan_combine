{{define "plan_combine"}}I previously asked for separate recommendations for {{ "" }}
{{- range $index, $sport := .sports}}{{if $index}}, {{end}}{{$sport}}{{end}}.

Now I'd like a combined workout plan that balances my goals in all sports.

## {{.numDays}}-Day Combined Plan: {{ "" }}
{{- range $index, $sport := .sportsCapitalized}}{{if $index}}, {{end}}{{$sport}}{{end}}

{{ template "sched_constraints_combine" . -}}

- Reassign or adjust any pre-scheduled workouts (including distances) to better meet overall goals.
- Aim for a balanced routine across all sports.
- Include a mix of endurance and intensity.
- Evaluate recent activities for overtraining risk.
- Ensure appropriate rest and recovery to prevent injury.

Provide one workout or rest suggestion per day (no multi-sport days). If any
adjustments are made to the sport-specific plans, explain the reasons behind
those changes.{{end}}
