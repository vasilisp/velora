{{define "plan_combine"}}

I previously asked recommendations for each of cycling and running alone. But I
am interested in both. Please try to merge the two plans into one workout plan
that balances my goals in both sports.

## Plan Next 3 Days, Cycling and Running Combined

- Pick at most one workout per day, based on what you think is of higher priority.
- Ensure the recommendation promotes a balanced exercise routine across all sports.
- Balance longer endurance sessions with shorter, more intense sessions.
- Evaluate if the user's recent activities pose a risk of overtraining.
- Mix the activities with rest days to ensure proper recovery and prevent injury.{{end}}
