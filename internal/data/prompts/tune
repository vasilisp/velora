{{define "tune"}}I would like you to help me build a good training dataset for
my fitness tracker and coaching assistant.

Below I describe the user data formats sent to the LLM at inference time.
Please examine the input and output formats carefully and produce a JSONL list
that includes 20 high-quality examples.

Each example should include both the input and the output one would expect from
the LLM. No system prompt is needed. The examples should be varied, e.g.,
include training data from inexperienced athletes all the way to elite cyclists
and triathletes, and cover all disciplines and mixes thereof.

I will use the training dataset to fine-tune an LLM for better performance.

The format should be JSONL containing pairs of input, output. Please provide
just the JSONL without any explanations or discussion. No wrappers or
formatting.
