{{define "tune"}}I would like you to help me build a good training dataset for
my fitness tracker and coaching assistant.

Below I describe the user data formats sent to the LLM at inference time.
Please examine the input and output formats carefully and produce a JSONL list
that includes 100 high-quality examples. 50 of them should include the system
prompt and 50 not. The examples should be varied, e.g., include training data
from inexperienced athletes all the way to elite cyclists and triathletes, and
cover all disciplines and mixes thereof.

I will use the training dataset to fine-tune an LLM for better performance.

The format should be JSONL as expected by Hugging Face.
