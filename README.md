# velora

**velora** is a command-line workout database with built-in adaptive coaching powered by AI. It focuses on cycling and running.

## Goals

- Create a simple, personal workout tracker. Existing tools like Strava and other training platforms are too complex for my needs.
- Explore the use of LLMs and machine learning in training recommendations.

## Roadmap

**velora** generates short-term training plans based on a userâ€™s workout history and goals. The plan is to experiment with different AI techniques to improve the quality and usefulness of these recommendations:

1. Start with prompt engineering to see how far it can go.
2. When that reaches its limits, fine-tune an LLM for better performance.
3. If LLMs fall short, explore traditional machine learning approaches.
